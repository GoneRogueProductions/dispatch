## Dispatch
### Why
- Talking is cool.
- But talking securely is cooler.
- So Dispatch lets you and your friends talk, securely!
- We took our shared skills and made a nice-looking, yet also functioning chat service.
- The code is available here for transparency (but not the passwords!)
### What
- Public chat
- Private chat
- Forums
- Profiles
- User lookup
- Admin features

### Mission Statement
Our mission is to make quality software that serves people. We don't steal your data. We use free services, and you never pay for anything. We don't use ads, and don't sell your data. You may think that WhatsApp is secure, but in the current day and age it is not, unfortunately. The internet today is controlled by bige tech companies. Lets change that, one small step at a time.
