Dispatch's tech stack

At the top we have vanilla JS and CSS. We also make use of Bootstrap and jQuery.

Then under the hood we have more JS, AJAX and PHP.

For hosting we have iterated through several
but we settled with 000webhost. It is free, though slow.

Our DNS for dispatch.ml comes free, from freenom. Great service!

In fact, no money has been spent on Dispatch - a completely free solution.

So we're not looking to make money from it ! :)
